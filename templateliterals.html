            //but by using template literals we can add like this

            //Another example
            //normally we will write like this
            console.log("the addition of two letters will give " +a +" and " +b + " is " +(a+b))
            //but by using template literals will be
            console.log(`the addition of two strings ${a} and ${b} is ${a+b}`)
